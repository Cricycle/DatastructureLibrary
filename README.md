# DatastructureLibrary
I want to learn more about data structures, so I'm going to go ahead and make my own.  Will probably be in Java, C++, C#, because why not. Easy ones first, to get into a rhythm.

As of 2015-3-22,

SimpleStack - A stack which doesn't resize larger/smaller
DynamicStack(untested) - A stack which will grow larger/smaller depending on your settings.
SimpleQueue - A queue which doesn't resize

RangeQueryTree1D(sort of tested) - Let's you define some sort of aggregation operation such that you want to find the max such aggregated subsequence of an array.
Also supports simple updates to the elements of the backing array. Made this one awhile back.
